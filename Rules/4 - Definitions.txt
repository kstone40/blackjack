**Expected Value**: $E(h(X)) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} h(x_i)P(X=x_i)$

_The average/expected outcome from a distribution, given the probability of all events._
_Consider a reward function which is dependent on the player and dealer cards before settling a hand
$R = h(c_P, c_D)$ so that the expected player reward of any dealt hand can be written as such:_

**Expected Value of a Hand (to Player)**: $E(R) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} h(c_P, c_D)P(C_P = c_P, C_D = c_D)$

$R = 2^{d_i} * h(c_P, c_D)$

$\text{where } d_i=  
\begin{dcases}
	1 & \text{if Double-down} \\
	0 & \text{else}
\end{dcases}
$

$\text{where } h(c_P, c_D) =  
\begin{dcases}
	0 & \text{if Push} \\
	1 & \text{if Won} \\
	1 & \text{if Dealer bust} \\
	1*\frac{3}{2} & \text{if Blackjack} \\
	-1 & \text{if Beat} \\
	-1 & \text{if Bust} \\
	-0.5 & \text{if Surrender}
\end{dcases}
$

**House Edge**: $E_H(R) = (1 - E(R))*100 \%$

_The expected value of the player's hand, with respect to the house, expressed as a percentage of the player's bet.
A house edge of 5% suggests an average return to the house of $5 per $100 bet made._

**Monte Carlo Simulation** The function of output probabilities $P(X)$ is determined empirically by simulating a set of events
based on input probabilities (e.g. random dealing from a deck) for a large number of events $x_i$. Functions of the output probability, including
expected values, can then be trivially calculated from the set of simulation outputs.

**Batch Means** The statistical analysis of point estimators evolving from a long-running simulation by breaking the simulation up into "batches"
and examining the means (or other statistics) of each batch.

**Probabilty Mass Function (PMF):** $f(x_i) = p = P(X=x_i)$

_The probability for each event $x_i$ within the range of possibilities $X$_

**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** $F(x_i) = P(X \leq x) = \sum_{x_i \leq x} f(x_i)$

_The cumulative probability for all events $x_i$ within the threshold $x$_
