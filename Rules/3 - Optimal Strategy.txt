The "optimal strategy" (a.k.a. "basic strategy") is a popular publication of recommended player actions
(to Hit, Stand, Double-down, or Split) based on their hand and the dealer upcard. It is widely accepted
that sticking to optimal/basic strategy is the best way for a player to increase their odds of success
(and reduce the house edge) without the aid of counting cards. 

Basic strategy is often divided into three or four sections.

**Hard Totals** Recommended action based on the sum of player cards.

**Soft Totals** Recommended action based on the 2nd player card, if the 1st is an Ace (which can bear two values) and the 2nd is a number (non-face) card.

**Splitting** When to split (or not) if the player's cards are equal in value, allowing a potential split.

**Surrender (Uncommon)** When to surrender (or not) for a few cases of unfavorable odds to the player.

such as disallowing double-down or surrender) might lead to changes in the expected return for a Blackjack player.**
